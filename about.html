  <h1>Time travel by code</h1>
  <p>When I find a special interest in something I provide full attention to it.</p>
  <p>Coding has become like a new fix for my sweet tooth.</p>
  <p>When ever I engage with it feels like a sugar high.</p>
  <p>Like a now and later which I'm enjoying at the moment.</p>
  <p> When I comes to savory my guilty pleassure is Suicide wings from Crumpy's.</p>
